# Firefly

I called this game Firefly when I thought I was going to make
a spaceship laser fighting game, and I never bothered updating
the name of the repository.

I've switched to something where it rains and there are some
characters, maybe some procedurally generated tiled map.

## Prerequisites
- [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- This game uses [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez) which apparently is fully supported on Linux and Windows, but not officially supported on Mac apparently. That doesn't mean it definitely won't work. I haven't tested it.

## Play
This game needs to run in optimised mode otherwise rendering all
those sprites makes performance terrible.

`cargo run --release`
